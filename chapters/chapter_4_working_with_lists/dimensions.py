# In python a list with immutable elements is called a tuple, and it uses () instead of []
dimensions = (200, 50)

print(dimensions[0])
print(dimensions[1])

# Tuples are indicated by the commas, the parens are just there to make it look neater, so even if your tuple 
# just has one element, it needs a trailing comma.

# Tuples can be looped through

# You may not be able to change the values of a tuple, but you can reassign a variable that contains a tuple with a 
# new one.
